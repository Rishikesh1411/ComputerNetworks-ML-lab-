**A comprehensive collection of machine learning lab experiments using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts a series of practical lab experiments focused on fundamental machine learning concepts and algorithms. Designed primarily for educational purposes within a Computer Networks and Machine Learning curriculum, it demonstrates various techniques for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation across diverse datasets. Each experiment is presented as a Jupyter Notebook, providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation.

## ✨ Features

-   🎯 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis and visualization of various datasets including advertising, house prices, per capita income, heart disease, Iris flower, test scores, and wine characteristics.
-   📈 **Regression Models:** Implementation of linear regression and other models for predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., house prices, per capita income).
-   📊 **Classification Models:** Application of classification algorithms for categorical predictions (e.g., heart disease prediction, Iris species classification).
-   🧠 **Clustering Algorithms:** Demonstration of unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering for grouping data points (e.g., wine clustering).
-   🔬 **Data Preprocessing:** Examples of data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling techniques.
-   📉 **Model Evaluation:** Techniques for assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To run these lab experiments, you'll need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, along with several popular data science libraries.

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8+
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rishikesh1411/ComputerNetworks-ML-lab-.git
    cd ComputerNetworks-ML-lab-
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    Since there isn't a `requirements.txt`, install common data science libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook/Lab**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```

5.  **Open the notebooks**
    Your browser should open to the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open any `.ipynb` file to explore and run the experiments.
